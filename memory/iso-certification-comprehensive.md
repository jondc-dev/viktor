# PART 1: ISO FUNDAMENTALS

## What is ISO?

The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** is an independent, non-governmental international organization that develops and publishes international standards. ISO itself does NOT certify organizations — certification is performed by external certification bodies like Bureau Veritas.

## Key Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **QMS** | Quality Management System |
| **Certification** | Independent written assurance that a system meets specific requirements |
| **Accreditation** | Formal recognition that a certification body operates according to international standards |
| **Conformity** | Meeting all requirements of the standard |
| **Nonconformity (NC)** | Failure to meet a requirement |
| **Major NC** | Significant failure affecting system effectiveness or product/service conformity |
| **Minor NC** | Isolated lapse not affecting overall system effectiveness |
| **Observation (OFI)** | Opportunity for improvement (not a failure) |
| **Corrective Action** | Action to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity |
| **Preventive Action** | Action to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity |
| **CAPA** | Corrective and Preventive Action system |
| **Documented Information** | Information required to be controlled and maintained |
| **Process** | Set of interrelated activities that transform inputs into outputs |
| **Audit** | Systematic, independent examination of the QMS |
| **Surveillance Audit** | Periodic audit to verify ongoing compliance |
| **Recertification Audit** | Full audit at end of certificate validity period |
