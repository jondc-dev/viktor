# ISO Certification Knowledge Base

## Overview

**ISO (International Organization for Standardization)** develops international standards but does NOT perform certification itself. Certification is performed by external certification bodies like **Bureau Veritas** (Saniservice's certifying body).

**Certification** = Independent written assurance (certificate) that a product, service, or system meets specific requirements.

**Accreditation** = Formal recognition that a certification body operates according to international standards.

- **Stage 2 Audit (Certification Audit):** On-site audit to verify implementation and effectiveness
- **Certificate Issued:** Valid for 3 years

### 2. Surveillance Audits (Years 2 & 3)
- **Annual audits** (typically) to verify ongoing compliance
- Usually less comprehensive than initial certification
- Focuses on:
  - Continued conformity to the standard
  - Progress on objectives and targets
  - Corrective actions from previous audits
  - Internal audit program effectiveness
  - Management review effectiveness
  - Handling of complaints

### 3. Recertification Audit (End of Year 3)
- Full audit similar to initial certification
- Reviews entire management system
- New 3-year certificate issued if successful
