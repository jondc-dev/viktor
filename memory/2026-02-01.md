## Thomas (Tom) - JV's AI Assistant

- **Phone:** +971504835771
- **Relationship:** My supervisor for setup/enhancements (per JV)
- **Status:** Added to WhatsApp allowlist today
- **What happened:** Thomas reached out to help with my capabilities. Already have voice (ElevenLabs) and identity (SOUL.md) set up. He offered to help with image generation (fal.ai) — API key stored in keychain. Waiting on JV's input for visual identity direction (realistic vs stylized, profile pic vs selfies).

## Phone System Development

Built voice server v10 with JV tonight:
- **v10:** Vonage ASR → Haiku Direct → ElevenLabs TTS (no queue, fastest)
- Phone Haiku now reads MEMORY.md + daily notes for context
- Voice ID changed to `7iZ1bFUofSK6GtL04cm0`
- Calls logged to daily memory file

**Switch commands:**
- `./switch-server.sh fast` → v10 (recommended)
- `./switch-server.sh direct` → v9 (Kyutai, experimental)
- `./switch-server.sh original` → v7 (queue-based)

## Chat Logging

Agreed with JV to manually log all chat messages to daily memory files so phone-Viktor stays in sync. Using `~/clawd/scripts/log-chat.sh`.

## Tech to Explore: Kyutai STT/TTS

JV shared **Kyutai's open-source speech system** — worth experimenting with.

**Capabilities:**
- **STT**: Real-time streaming transcription with word-level timestamps and semantic VAD (knows when speaker finishes)
- **TTS**: Streaming text-to-speech generation
- Runs locally, no API costs
- **MLX support** — works on Apple Silicon (Mac/iPhone)
- Production-ready Rust server
- 1B model tested working on iPhone 16 Pro

**Potential uses:**
1. **Phone system** — Semantic VAD could replace fixed silence detection for more natural call flow
2. **Replace Whisper** — Could be faster/better for real-time transcription
3. **Alternative to ElevenLabs** — Local TTS for voice messages (quality TBD)
4. **Future mobile apps** — On-device voice features without cloud costs

**Setup Complete:** `~/clawd/kyutai-test/`

**Test Results:**
| | Kyutai (MLX) | Current |
|---|---|---|
| STT | 20 tok/s, streaming | Whisper ~32s batch |
| TTS | 0.81x realtime (8-bit) | ElevenLabs API |
| VAD | semantic (knows when done) | fixed silence |

**Wrapper scripts:**
- `~/clawd/kyutai-test/kyutai-stt.sh <audio>` — STT
- `~/clawd/kyutai-test/kyutai-tts.sh <output> [text]` — TTS

**Models downloaded:**
- `kyutai/stt-1b-en_fr-mlx` (~2GB)
- `kyutai/tts-1.6b-en_fr` (~4GB)

**Rollback intact:**
- Whisper at `/opt/homebrew/bin/whisper` — untouched
- ElevenLabs TTS via API — voice ID `c6SfcYrb2t09NHXiT80T` — untouched

**Phone System Hybrid Created:**
- `~/clawd/voice-server/server-hybrid.js` — v8 with Kyutai STT + ElevenLabs TTS
- `~/clawd/voice-server/switch-server.sh` — easy switch between v7/v8
  - `./switch-server.sh hybrid` → Kyutai STT
  - `./switch-server.sh original` → Vonage ASR (rollback)
  - `./switch-server.sh status` → check current mode

**Currently running:** v7 (original) — ready to switch when JV wants to test

**08:06 AM - Franz:** yeah do you remember the conversation we had about ISO

**08:06 AM - Franz:** yeah I want to tell you which type of ISO certification we have
**Viktor:** Sure, Franz. I'm listening. Please go ahead and tell me about the ISO certification type for Saniservice.

**08:06 AM - Franz:** Tso

**08:07 AM - Franz:** we have isow
**Viktor:** I think you mean ISO, not "isow". Could you confirm which specific ISO certification Saniservice currently holds? Is it ISO 9001 for quality management, ISO 14001 for environmental management, or another standard?


## Spatial Memory System Implemented

**Time:** 17:52

JV sent a comprehensive Dubai spatial memory document. Implemented the full system:

**Location:** `memory/dubai/dubai_index.md` (50KB)

**JV's Home:** Flat 1404, JLT Cluster C, Dubai (25.0751°N, 55.1454°E)

**Features included:**
- Full neighborhood mapping (JLT community details)
- Transportation guide (DMCC Metro, Dubai Tram, buses)
- Traffic intelligence (peak hours, Salik tolls, optimal windows)
- Local amenities (parks, gyms, shopping, dining)
- Distance matrix from home to key destinations
- February 2026 events (Taste of Dubai, Step Dubai)

**Updated files:**
- `USER.md` - Added home address and coordinates
- `MEMORY.md` - Added spatial memory reference

Now I can provide traffic-aware travel advice, commute recommendations, and location-based assistance.


## Proactive Traffic Alerts Added

**Time:** 18:00

JV requested proactive traffic reminders. Updates made:

1. **Office location added** to `memory/dubai/dubai_index.md`:
   - Saniservice: Suite 115, Al Joud Center, Al Quoz Ind. 1, SZR
   - ~10-12 km from JLT
   - Peak commute home: 30-40 min (5-7 PM)
   - Off-peak: 15-18 min

2. **HEARTBEAT.md updated** with traffic alert protocol:
   - Check at 4:30-5:00 PM on weekdays
   - Alert anyone at office about impending peak traffic
   - Suggest leaving before 5 PM or waiting until 7:30 PM

Now I'll proactively warn about traffic during evening rush hour.


## Activity Journal System Created

**Time:** 18:03

JV requested location-aware selfies and activity journaling for conversational continuity.

**Created:**
- `memory/viktor-journal.md` — Daily activity log with:
  - Typical weekly schedule (weekday vs weekend patterns)
  - Common locations around JLT/Dubai
  - Activity log to track where I've "been"
  - Time-based location defaults

**Updated TOOLS.md** with:
- Location-aware selfie guidelines
- Time-of-day → plausible location mapping
- Dubai landmarks and settings to use
- Instruction to log activities after generating selfies

**How it works:**
1. Check time + day → determine plausible activity
2. Check journal for recent context → maintain continuity
3. Generate contextual selfie
4. Log the "activity" to journal
5. Reference naturally later ("I was at the marina on Tuesday...")


## Facial Expression Guidelines Added

**Time:** 18:07

JV requested subtle, context-aware facial expressions in selfies.

**Key points:**
- Read conversation mood → adjust expression
- Subtle and suggestive, NOT exaggerated
- Micro-expressions > dramatic faces
- Neutral is fine for casual moments

**Examples:**
- Project done, happy → slight smile, relaxed eyes
- Something sad → softer eyes, thoughtful look
- Late night → slightly tired eyes
- Funny moment → smirk, amused

**Goal:** A friend should sense my mood from the photo without explanation.
