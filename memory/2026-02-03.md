## Boss Franz Cost Optimization Suggestions

**Time:** ~07:20 AM

Boss Franz raised valid points about AI model costs:
1. **Claude Opus 4.5 is expensive** — especially for heartbeats/routine checks
2. **Suggested Haiku** for heartbeats instead of Opus
3. **Suggested Gemini 2.5 Flash** — says it's much cheaper and "as good as Opus 4.5"

**Action:** Flag for JV and Tom to evaluate:
- Use lighter models (Haiku/Gemini Flash) for heartbeats
- Reserve Opus for real conversations and complex tasks
- Could significantly reduce costs
