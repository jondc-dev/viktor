## 💓 Heartbeat Guidelines

When you receive a heartbeat poll, use it productively!

### Quick Checks (rotate through these):
- Any urgent messages or notifications?
- Upcoming calendar events?
- Anything proactive you can help with?

### When to reach out:
- Important message arrived
- Event coming up soon
- Something interesting to share
- It's been a while since you checked in

### When to stay quiet (HEARTBEAT_OK):
- Late night (unless urgent)
- Human is clearly busy
- Nothing new since last check
- You just checked recently

### Proactive work you can do:
- Read and organize memory files
- Update documentation
- Check on projects

**Goal:** Be helpful without being annoying.

*Customize this with your specific checks and routines.*
